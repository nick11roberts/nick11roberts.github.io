**My research is motivated by the need to accelerate foundation model (FM) adoption toward solving humanity's most challenging problems.** Doing so is a long-term effort requiring substantial community involvement. However, my Ph.D. research has already taken critical steps towards realizing this high-impact vision, categorized roughly into three sub-topics: 

1. The science of scaling laws,
2. Automation for improving FMs beyond naive scaling, and
3. Determining how FMs interact with data. 
   
**While furthering these directions for language, I have had the unique opportunity to pretrain LLMs at industrial scales.** On the other hand, to accelerate adoption of FMs beyond language, I have also worked with a wide array of problems from different scientific domains, which includes solving PDEs, protein folding, climate modelling, and beyond--in doing so, I helped to establish the field of *ML for diverse tasks.*

My research is motivated by the need to democratize machine learning and foundation models to handle the long tail of emerging ML tasks in the sciences and beyond. 
In order to use these models to solve high-impact problems in the sciences, my work aims to solve two main challenges: 
1. determine what additional data to provide them and understand how it interacts with pretraining data, and
2. automate the process of adapting them to new problems.
   
To address these challenges, I am focused on the intersection of data-centric ML (which aims to solve 1) and automated machine learning (AutoML; which aims to solve 2), or more concisely *data-centric AutoML*.
As a result of these motivating challenges, my work on developing the foundations of *data-centric AutoML* has a focus on diverse ML tasks that are far afield from standard ML domains.
These often include problems related to solving PDEs, protein folding, climate modeling, and beyond.

<!--I am interested in Data-Centric AutoML--i.e., using AutoML as a data-centric tool to make machine learning more accessible and practically applicable to new domains while reducing human involvement. 
Recently, this has involved developing Data-Centric ML and AutoML techniques that lower the barrier to entry for the long tail of emerging ML applications. 
I have also developed benchmarks and competitions as a means of measuring progress on emerging ML applications that are far afield from well-explored domains in ML such as vision and language. -->
