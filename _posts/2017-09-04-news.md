- Three papers (and a competition) to appear in NeurIPS '22: 
  - [Benchmarking neural architecture search on diverse tasks][nasbench360]
  - [Benchmark for automated weak supervision][awsbench101] across diverse tasks
  - We lift the favorable theoretical properties of binary weak supervision to structured prediction
- Jointly leading the [AutoML Decathlon][decathlon] competition at NeurIPS '22: an AutoML competition for diverse tasks!  
  - We are partnering with the [AutoML Fall School][automlfallschool] to host an [AutoML Decathlon][decathlon] hackathon! 
- Selected for the [Jacquelin Perry][prove-fellowship] [Prove AI Fellowship!][prove]
- At ICLR '22: our work on lifting weak supervision to diverse settings: [regression, rankings, manifolds, graphs, and more!][uws]
- At NeurIPS '21: we re-imagine NAS operation spaces for diverse tasks: [PDE solvers, protein folding, music modeling, and beyond!][xd]
- I have started my Ph.D. at UW Madison!
