- Excited to have been selected to participate in the [ML and Systems Rising Stars program][mlsys_rising_stars], part of [MLCommons][mlcommons]! 
- Announcing the [AutoML Cup][automl_cup] competition! More details soon -- stay tuned! 
  - Part of the [AutoML Conference 2023][automl_conf], where I am a Competition Chair. 
- I will be interning at [Microsoft Research][msr] Redmond this summer with [Debadeepta Dey][dey] and [Yi Zhang][yi]! 
- [Patent from my 2018 internship at Intuit has been issued by the US Patent Office][intuitpatent]
- At ICLR '23: our work on fusing weak supervision with GANs [showcases mutual empirical and theoretical benefits][wsgan]
- At NeurIPS '22, three papers, a competition, and a workshop paper: 
  - [Benchmarking neural architecture search on diverse tasks][nasbench360]
  - [Benchmark for automated weak supervision across diverse tasks][awsbench101]
  - [We lift the favorable theoretical properties of binary weak supervision to structured prediction][wssp]
  - Jointly leading the [AutoML Decathlon][decathlon] competition at NeurIPS '22: an AutoML competition for diverse tasks!  
    - We are partnering with the [AutoML Fall School][automlfallschool] to host an [AutoML Decathlon][decathlon] hackathon! 
  - We call on the AutoML community to [develop automated methods aimed at high-impact climate change problems][automlccai]
- Selected for the [Jacquelin Perry][prove-fellowship] [Prove AI Fellowship!][prove]
- At ICLR '22: our work on lifting weak supervision to diverse settings: [regression, rankings, manifolds, graphs, and more!][uws]
- At NeurIPS '21: we re-imagine NAS operation spaces for diverse tasks: [PDE solvers, protein folding, music modeling, and beyond!][xd]
- I have started my Ph.D. at UW Madison!
