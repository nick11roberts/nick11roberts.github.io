**Research Interests** 

**My research is motivated by the need to accelerate foundation model (FM) adoption toward solving humanity's most challenging problems.** Doing so is a long-term effort requiring substantial community involvement. However, my Ph.D. research has already taken critical steps towards realizing this high-impact vision, categorized roughly into three sub-topics: 

1. The science of scaling laws,
2. Automation for improving FMs beyond naive scaling, and
3. Determining how FMs interact with data. 
   
**While furthering these directions for language, I have had the unique opportunity to pretrain LLMs at industrial scales.** On the other hand, to accelerate adoption of FMs beyond language, I have also worked with a wide array of problems from different scientific domains, which includes solving PDEs, protein folding, climate modelling, and beyond--in doing so, I helped to establish the field of *ML for diverse tasks.*
