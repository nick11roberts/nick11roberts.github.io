#### Hi, I'm Nick!

__`UPDATE` I have been selected for an honorable mention for the Computing Research Association's (CRA) [Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award for 2019][CRA]!__

I am a [UC San Diego][contact] senior pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

I have a strong interest in machine learning research.
On that front, I am currently
  * Doing research in [The Cottrell Lab][cottrell], led by Professor Gary Cottrell, involving clustering for drug discovery
  * Working with Professor Sanjoy Dasgupta on a new human-in-the-loop feedback model ([check out our paper at NeurIPS 2018][NeurIPS])
  * Exploring new probabilistic deep learning models in addition to quantifying adversarial examples with Professor David Meyer

I had the exciting opportunity to tutor for both DSC 10 (Principles of Data Science) and DSC 20 (Data Structures for Data Science) in the new [Data Science major at UCSD][dsc] under Janine Tiefenbruck and Marina Langlois, respectively.

In addition, I have held positions in several organizations at UCSD, among these, I was the data analyst for the [Triton Engineering Student Council][tesc], a machine learning workshop facilitator for the [Data Science Student Society at UCSD][ds3], and a house leader for [Tau Beta Pi, California Psi][tbp].

When I'm not stumbling down high dimensional cost functions or shopping for GPUs, I can be found enjoying a shot of espresso, taking photos, making pottery, writing music, or unsuccessfully trying to convince myself to not purchase fake Yeezys or vintage windbreakers I don't need. Oops, I just bought another vintage windbreaker.

<!--Besides academia, internships, caffeine, and ill-advised online purchases, I enjoy maintaining my Toyota Prius' radio volume within the first equivalence class of the congruence modulo 5 relation, and that's... That's about it really.-->
