<!--#### Hi, I'm Nick!-->

I am a Ph.D. student in CS at [University of Wisconsin -- Madison][wisc] where I am advised by [Fred Sala][fred]. Before that, I had the pleasure of working with [Ameet Talwalkar][ameet] and [Zack Lipton][zack] during my MS at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. As an undergraduate, I was extremely fortunate to work with both [Sanjoy Dasgupta][sanjoy] and [Gary Cottrell][gary] at the [University of California, San Diego][ucsd]. Before that, I was a community college student at [Fresno City College][fcc], where I was lucky enough to learn calculus, linear algebra, **AND** C++ from [Greg Jamison][greg]. 

I am broadly interested in making machine learning more accessible and applicable to new domains. As of recent, I've been particularly interested in model selection and automation. 

Other interests: caffeine (broadly), photography, pottery. 

Extracurricular: I'm an [ordained Dudeist priest][dude] so I'm pretty sure I can officiate weddings. I'm also the Head Researcher of Margarita Machine Lounge Therapy at [Vacation Inc.][vacation] - I encourage you to check out our awesome selection of luxury sunscreens. [My Toyota Prius is unoffocially the fastest Prius at Bonneville Speedway][prius].
