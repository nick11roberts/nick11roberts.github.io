#### Hi there, I'm Nick!

I am a [UC San Diego][contact] junior pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in `Computer Science` with a minor in Mathematics.

I have a strong interest in machine learning research and software engineering.
I am currently a deep learning researcher at Altum, doing research in [The Cottrell Lab][cottrell], and working on a neat computer vision project involving Pokemon with Professor Sanjoy Dasgupta.

I have tutored for DSC 10 (Principles of Data Science) and DSC 20 (Data Structures for Data Science) in the new [Data Science major at UCSD][dsc].

In addition, I am the data analyst for the [Triton Engineering Student Council][tesc], a machine learning workshop facilitator for the [Data Science Student Society at UCSD][ds3], a house leader for [Tau Beta Pi, California Psi][tbp].

When I'm not coding, I can be found enjoying a shot of espresso, doing photography, pottery, or attempting to surf.

I am looking for `Summer 2019 data science or software engineering internship`, if you are interested, please [contact me][contact]!
