#### Hi, I'm Nick!

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in CS at [University of Wisconsin -- Madison][wisc]. Formerly [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu], [University of California, San Diego][ucsd], and [Fresno City College][fcc]. I am broadly interested in making machine learning more accessible and applicable to new domains. As of recent, I've been particularly interested in model selection and AutoML. 

Other interests: caffeine (broadly), photography, pottery. 

Extracurricular: I'm an [ordained Dudeist priest][dude] so I'm pretty sure I can officiate weddings. I'm also the Head Researcher of Margarita Machine Lounge Therapy at [Vacation Inc.][vacation] - I encourage you to check out our awesome selection of luxury sunscreens.
