<!--#### Hi, I'm Nick!-->

**Academic Bio:** 

I am a Ph.D. student in CS at [University of Wisconsin--Madison][wisc] where I am advised by [Fred Sala][fred]. 
Before that, I had the pleasure of working with [Ameet Talwalkar][ameet] and [Zack Lipton][zack] during my MS in the Machine Learning Department at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. 
As an undergraduate, I was extremely fortunate to work with both [Sanjoy Dasgupta][sanjoy] and [Gary Cottrell][gary] at the [University of California, San Diego][ucsd]. 
Prior to all of this, I was a community college student at [Fresno City College][fcc], where I was lucky enough to learn calculus, linear algebra, *and* C++ from [Greg Jamison][greg]. 

**Research Interests:** 

I am interested in Data-Centric AutoML--i.e., making machine learning more accessible and practically applicable to new domains while reducing human involvement. 
More specifically, I develop Data-Centric ML and AutoML techniques that lower the barrier to entry for the long tail of emerging ML applications. 
I have also developed benchmarks and competitions as a means of measuring progress on emerging ML applications that are far afield from well-explored domains in ML such as vision and language.
<!--Recently, I've been working on automated dataset construction and model selection for diverse tasks---i.e., beyond well-explored domains in ML such as vision and language. -->
