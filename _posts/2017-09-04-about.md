#### Hi, I'm Nick!

I am an MS student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon AI][amazonai] in the AWS Transcribe group, and before that, I was a Machine Learner Intern and AI Fellow at [UnifyID][unifyid]. I am passionate about making machine learning safer and more secure, as well as integrating humanness into machine learning. 

Coffee snob, taker of photos, maker of pottery.

DnD class (homebrew rules): `Wizard/Bard/Cobbler` hybrid.  

"`My key to dealing with stress is simple:` `just stay cool and stay focused.`" -Ashton Eaton (found via the first result of a Google search for 'cool quotes').
