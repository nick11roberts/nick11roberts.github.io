#### Hi, I'm Nick!

I am an MS student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon AI][amazonai] in the AWS Transcribe group, and before that, I was a Machine Learner Intern and AI Fellow at [UnifyID][unifyid]. My interests include automating machine learning, aligning machine learning systems with human expectations, and machine learning security. 

Coffee snob, taker of photos, maker of pottery.

DnD class (homebrew rules): `Wizard/Bard/Cobbler` hybrid.  

"`My key to dealing with stress is simple:` `just stay cool and stay focused.`" -Ashton Eaton (cheesy quote courtesy of the first Google search result for 'cool quotes').
