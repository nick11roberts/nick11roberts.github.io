<!--#### Hi, I'm Nick!-->

**Academic Bio:** 

I am a Ph.D. student in CS at [University of Wisconsin -- Madison][wisc] where I am advised by [Fred Sala][fred]. Before that, I had the pleasure of working with [Ameet Talwalkar][ameet] and [Zack Lipton][zack] during my MS at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. As an undergraduate, I was extremely fortunate to work with both [Sanjoy Dasgupta][sanjoy] and [Gary Cottrell][gary] at the [University of California, San Diego][ucsd]. Before that, I was a community college student at [Fresno City College][fcc], where I was lucky enough to learn calculus, linear algebra, *and* C++ from [Greg Jamison][greg]. 

**Research Interests:** 

I am interested in making machine learning more accessible and applicable to new domains. This has taken the form of diversifying the application scope of automated dataset generation and model selection techniques. 

**Extracurricular:** 
- Sailing
- Photography
- Pottery

**Extra-Extracurricular:** 
- *[Ordained Dudeist priest][dude]*. I can legally officiate weddings in the US. If you'd like to book me for your wedding, please free to reach out. 
- *[Head Researcher of Margarita Machine Lounge Therapy at Vacation Inc.][vacation]* Check out our selection of luxury sunscreens today!<sup>1</sup> 
- *[Unofficial Toyota Prius landspeed record holder at Bonneville Speedway][prius]*.
