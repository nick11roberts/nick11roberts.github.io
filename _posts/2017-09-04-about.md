#### Hi, I'm Nick!

__`UPDATE` I have been selected for an honorable mention for the Computing Research Association's (CRA) [Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award for 2019][CRA]!__

I am an incoming MS student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. I am currently working at [UnifyID][unifyid], where I am an AI Fellow and a Machine Learner Intern. I am passionate about making machine learning safer and more secure, as well is integrating humanness into machine learning.

Coffee snob, taker of photos, maker of pottery.

DnD class (homebrew rules): `Wizard/Bard/Cobbler` hybrid.  

"`My key to dealing with stress is simple:` `just stay cool and stay focused.`" -Ashton Eaton (found via the first result of a Google search for 'cool quotes').
