#### Hi there, I'm Nick!

I am a [`UC San Diego`][contact] junior pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in `Computer Science` with a minor in Mathematics. I have a strong interest in in data science and software engineering.
I am currently interning at [`Teradata`][teradata], doing research in [`The Cottrell Lab`][cottrell], and lending a technical hand to a nonprofit called [`The Comeback Community`][comeback].

I am looking for `Summer 2018 software engineering internship`, if you are interested, please [contact me][contact]!
