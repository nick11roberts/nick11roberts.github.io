#### Hi there, I'm Nick!

I am a [UC San Diego][contact] junior pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in `Computer Science` with a minor in Mathematics. I have a strong interest in in data science and software engineering.
I am currently interning at [Teradata][teradata], doing research in [The Cottrell Lab][cottrell], and lending a technical hand to a nonprofit called [The Comeback Community][comeback].

In addition, I am the `data analyst` for the [Triton Engineering Student Council][tesc], a `machine learning workshop facilitator` for the [Data Science Student Society at UCSD][ds3], and a `house leader` in [Tau Beta Pi, California Psi][tbp]. 

I am looking for `Summer 2018 software engineering internship`, if you are interested, please [contact me][contact]!
