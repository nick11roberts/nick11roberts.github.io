#### Hi, I'm Nick!

I am a [UC San Diego][contact] senior pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in `Computer Science` with a minor in Mathematics.

I have a strong interest in machine learning research.
I am currently doing research in [The Cottrell Lab][cottrell] involving clustering for drug discovery, working with Professor Sanjoy Dasgupta on a new model of interactive learning ([check out our paper at NeurIPS 2018][NeurIPS]), and exploring new deep probabilistic models in addition to addressing adversarial examples with Professor David Meyer in the Mathematics department.

I had the awesome opportunity to tutor for DSC 10 (Principles of Data Science) and DSC 20 (Data Structures for Data Science) in the new [Data Science major at UCSD][dsc] under Janine Tiefenbruck and Marina Langlois, respectively.

In addition, I have held positions in several organizations at UCSD, among these, I was the data analyst for the [Triton Engineering Student Council][tesc], a machine learning workshop facilitator for the [Data Science Student Society at UCSD][ds3], and a house leader for [Tau Beta Pi, California Psi][tbp].

When I'm not digitally (and sometimes clumsily) stumbling down high dimensional cost functions, I can be found enjoying a shot (several shots) of espresso, doing photography, pottery, attempting to surf, making music, or unsuccessfully trying to convince myself not to purchase fake Yeezys.
