#### Hi, I'm Nick!

I am an incoming Ph.D. student in CS at the [University of Wisconsin -- Madison][wisc]. Formerly [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu] and the [University of California, San Diego][ucsd]. I'm currently broadly interested in making machine learning more accessible and applicable to new domains. In particular, I've recently been working on areas related to model selection including AutoML. 

Other interests: caffine-broadly, photography, pottery. 

Extracurricular: [ordained Dudeist priest][dude], Head Researcher of Margarita Machine Lounge Therapy at [Vacation Inc.][vacation].
