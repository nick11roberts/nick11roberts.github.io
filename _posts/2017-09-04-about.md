#### Hi there, I'm Nick!

I am a [UC San Diego][contact] junior pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in `Computer Science` with a minor in Mathematics.

I have a strong interest in data science and software engineering.
I am currently interning at [Teradata][teradata], doing research in [The Cottrell Lab][cottrell], and lending a technical hand to a nonprofit called [The Comeback Community][comeback].

In addition, I am a tutor for DSC 10 (Intro to Programming) in the new [Data Science major at UCSD][dsc], the data analyst for the [Triton Engineering Student Council][tesc], a machine learning workshop facilitator for the [Data Science Student Society at UCSD][ds3], and a house leader in [Tau Beta Pi, California Psi][tbp].

When I'm not coding, I can be found enjoying a shot of espresso, cooking, deep into my music playlist, or attempting to surf.

I am looking for `Summer 2018 software engineering internship`, if you are interested, please [contact me][contact]!
