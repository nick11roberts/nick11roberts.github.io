I"=<h4 id="hi-im-nick">Hi, I’m Nick!</h4>

<p>I am a Ph.D. student in CS at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin – Madison</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/">Fred Sala</a>. Before that, I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/">Ameet Talwalkar</a> and <a href="http://zacklipton.com">Zack Lipton</a> during my MS at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. As an undergraduate, I was extremely fortunate to work with both <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/">Sanjoy Dasgupta</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/">Gary Cottrell</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>. Before that, I was a community college student at <a href="https://www.fresnocitycollege.edu">Fresno City College</a>, where I was lucky enough to learn calculus, linear algebra, <strong>AND</strong> C++ from <a href="https://greg.jamison.cc/home.php">Greg Jamison</a>.</p>

<p>I am broadly interested in making machine learning more accessible and applicable to new domains. As of recent, I’ve been particularly interested in model selection and automation.</p>

<p>Other interests: caffeine (broadly), photography, pottery.</p>

<p>Extracurricular: I’m an <a href="https://dudeism.com">ordained Dudeist priest</a> so I’m pretty sure I can officiate weddings. I’m also the Head Researcher of Margarita Machine Lounge Therapy at <a href="https://www.vacation.inc">Vacation Inc.</a> - I encourage you to check out our awesome selection of luxury sunscreens. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQIVWAxg4NX/">My Toyota Prius is unoffocially the fastest Prius at Bonneville Speedway</a>.</p>
