I"H<!--#### Hi, I'm Nick!-->

<p><strong>Academic Bio:</strong></p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. student in CS at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin – Madison</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/">Fred Sala</a>. Before that, I had the pleasure of working with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/">Ameet Talwalkar</a> and <a href="http://zacklipton.com">Zack Lipton</a> during my MS at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. As an undergraduate, I was extremely fortunate to work with both <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/">Sanjoy Dasgupta</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/">Gary Cottrell</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>. Before that, I was a community college student at <a href="https://www.fresnocitycollege.edu">Fresno City College</a>, where I was lucky enough to learn calculus, linear algebra, <em>and</em> C++ from <a href="https://greg.jamison.cc/home.php">Greg Jamison</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Research Interests:</strong></p>

<p>I am interested in making machine learning more accessible and applicable to new domains. Recently, I’ve been working on automated dataset construction and model selection for diverse tasks—i.e., beyond well-explored domains in ML such as vision and language.</p>
