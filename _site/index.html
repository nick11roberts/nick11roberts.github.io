        <!--#### Hi, I'm Nick!-->

<!--
**Academic Bio** 
-->

<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in CS at <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/">Fred Sala</a> along with my many talented colleagues in the <a href="https://sprocketlab.github.io/">Sprocket Lab</a>.</p>

<p>This past Fall, I interned with the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/meta-ai/">Llama Generative AI</a> team at Meta in London, where I worked with <a href="https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/">Dieuwke Hupkes</a> on language model pretraining and evaluation. 
This past Summer, I interned at <a href="https://www.together.ai/">Together AI</a> in San Francisco with <a href="https://tridao.me/">Tri Dao</a>, where I worked on hybrid language models. 
In Summer 2023, I interned with the Physics of AGI research group at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a> led by <a href="http://sbubeck.com/">Sébastien Bubeck</a>, where I also worked on language models.</p>

<p>Before starting my Ph.D., I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/">Ameet Talwalkar</a> and <a href="https://www.zacharylipton.com/">Zack Lipton</a> during my M.S. in the Machine Learning Department at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. 
As an undergraduate, I was extremely fortunate to work with both <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/">Sanjoy Dasgupta</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/">Gary Cottrell</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</a>. 
Prior to all of this, I was a community college student at <a href="https://www.fresnocitycollege.edu">Fresno City College</a>, where I was lucky enough to learn calculus, linear algebra, <em>and</em> C++ from <a href="https://greg.jamison.cc/home.php">Greg Jamison</a>.</p>

<p>In 2025 I received an honorable mention for the <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/grf-profiles-2025/">Jane Street Graduate Research Fellowship</a> and in 2023, I was named an <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/">MLCommons</a> <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/news/rising-stars-2023/">Rising Star</a>. I have also been awarded the Prove AI and UnifyID AI Fellowships in 2021 and 2019, respectively.</p>

**Research Interests** 

**My research is motivated by the need to accelerate foundation model (FM) adoption toward solving humanity's most challenging problems.** Doing so is a long-term effort requiring substantial community involvement. However, my Ph.D. research has already taken critical steps towards realizing this high-impact vision, categorized roughly into three sub-topics: 

1. The science of scaling laws,
2. Automation for improving FMs beyond naive scaling, and
3. Determining how FMs interact with data. 
   
**While furthering these directions for language, I have had the unique opportunity to pretrain LLMs at industrial scales.** On the other hand, to accelerate adoption of FMs beyond language, I have also worked with a wide array of problems from different scientific domains, which includes solving PDEs, protein folding, climate modelling, and beyond--in doing so, I helped to establish the field of *ML for diverse tasks.* 


<hr style="height:10px;">

-->

<!--
My research is motivated by the need to democratize machine learning and foundation models to handle the long tail of emerging ML tasks in the sciences and beyond. 
In order to use these models to solve high-impact problems in the sciences, my work aims to solve two main challenges: 
1. determine what additional data to provide them and understand how it interacts with pretraining data, and
2. automate the process of adapting them to new problems.
   
To address these challenges, I am focused on the intersection of data-centric ML (which aims to solve 1) and automated machine learning (AutoML; which aims to solve 2), or more concisely *data-centric AutoML*.
As a result of these motivating challenges, my work on developing the foundations of *data-centric AutoML* has a focus on diverse ML tasks that are far afield from standard ML domains.
These often include problems related to solving PDEs, protein folding, climate modeling, and beyond.
-->

<!--I am interested in Data-Centric AutoML--i.e., using AutoML as a data-centric tool to make machine learning more accessible and practically applicable to new domains while reducing human involvement. 
Recently, this has involved developing Data-Centric ML and AutoML techniques that lower the barrier to entry for the long tail of emerging ML applications. 
I have also developed benchmarks and competitions as a means of measuring progress on emerging ML applications that are far afield from well-explored domains in ML such as vision and language. -->
