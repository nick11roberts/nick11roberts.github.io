		I started programming when I was a junior at 
		<a href="http://www.fresnounified.org/schools/high/bullard/default.aspx" class="aLinkSacramento">Bullard High School</a> 
		and the <a href="http://cart.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">Center for Advanced Research and Technology</a>.
		<br />
		What really got me hooked on code, was the 
		<a href="http://cart.org/labs/web-application-development-rop/" class="aLinkSacramento">Web Application Development</a> 
		lab at CART. 
		<br />
		During my senior year, I was on the competitive team for Bullard's
		<a href="http://www.usad.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">Academic Decathlon</a> team, 
		<br />
		and I was also the vice president of that team. 
		<br />
		During my junior and senior years of high school, I was a member of the 
		<a href="http://csf-cjsf.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">California Scholarship Federation</a>.
