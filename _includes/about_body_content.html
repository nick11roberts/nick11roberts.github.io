		I started programming when I was a junior at 
		<a href="http://www.fresnounified.org/schools/high/bullard/default.aspx" class="aLinkSacramento">Bullard High School</a> 
		and the <a href="http://cart.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">Center for Advanced Research and Technology</a>.
		<br />
		What really got me hooked on code, was the 
		<a href="http://cart.org/labs/web-application-development-rop/" class="aLinkSacramento">Web Application Development</a> 
		lab at CART. 
		<br />
		During my senior year, I was on the competitive team for Bullard's
		<a href="http://www.usad.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">Academic Decathlon</a> team, 
		<br />
		and I was also the vice president of that team. 
		<br />
		During my junior and senior years of high school, I was a member of the 
		<a href="http://csf-cjsf.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">California Scholarship Federation</a>, 
		and I'm still a life member.
		<br />
		After I graduated high school, I was an IT intern at the 
		<a href="http://www.fresnosheriff.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">Fresno County Sheriff's Department</a> for a summer. 
		<br />
		Soon came the start of my first semester in the 
		<a href="http://www.fresnocitycollege.edu/index.aspx?page=2466" class="aLinkSacramento">Fresno City College Leon S. Peters Honors Program</a>.
		<br />
		Since I've been there, I've worked on some pretty cool school related projects, 
		such as a 
		<a href="https://github.com/Team2-CSCI40/LineEditorProject" class="aLinkSacramento">line editor</a> and 
		<a href="https://github.com/Team1-CSCI41/asteroidsProject" class="aLinkSacramento">asteroids on linux</a>,
		as well as some very simple Android apps, such as 
		<a href="https://github.com/TeamRRocket-CIT65/midtermProgrammingAssignment" class="aLinkSacramento">this useless thing</a> and 
		<a href="https://github.com/Final-Group-CIT-65/finalProgrammingAssignment" class="aLinkSacramento">this slightly more useful calculator app</a>. 
		<br />
		I've also been in a few clubs at Fresno City, such as 
		<a href="https://twitter.com/citzero" class="aLinkSacramento">CITzero</a> and the 
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/FCC-Science-and-Engineering-Club/257610644364049" class="aLinkSacramento">Science and Engineering</a> club. 
		<br />
		I'm also a part of 
		<a href="http://gdgfresno.com/#/about" class="aLinkSacramento">Google Developer Group Fresno</a>.
		<br />
		Since my first two semesters in college, I've been independently studying 
		<a href="http://arduino.cc/" class="aLinkSacramento">Arduino</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="aLinkSacramento">Raspberry Pi</a>
		as well as other cool electrical things.
